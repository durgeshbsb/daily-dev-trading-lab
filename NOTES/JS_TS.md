## closures in js ts

A local variable is a "private" variable defined inside a function.
A global variable is a "public" variable defined outside a function.

Global variables live until the page is discarded, like when you navigate to another page or close the window.
Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished.

A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, after the parent function has closed.

Closures has historically been used to:

Create private variables
Preserve state between function calls
Simulate block-scoping before let and const existed
Implement certain design patterns like currying and memoization

modern js use class instead of closures

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
prototype is like class also

> type casting  : Number() -> Type(x) just like in php Type x or String x
> type Coercion is implicit(automatic) while type conversion is explicit(manual). both do same thing
